        <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold m-5 text-blue-500">The use cases of null and undefined</h1>
        <p class="text-xl font-semibold m-5">
                Null: "null" means is having no value. The same meaning is analogous to the meaning of null in programming.
    
                Null is basically an assignment value given to a variable. The variable which has been assigned as null contains no value.
                
                When we assign null as a value to any variable, it means that it is empty or blank. It is to show that the variable has no value. Also, null is an object in JavaScript. When it gets assigned to a variable, it represents no value. The setting of the value must be done manually by the user as JavaScript never sets the value as null. An object can be emptied by setting it to null.<br>
            Undefined:undefined means "not defined". So we declare a variable but do not assign a value to it, the variable becomes undefined.the value of an undefined variable is set by JavaScript as undefined. The variable gets created at the run-time. When we do not pass an argument for a function parameter, the default value is taken as undefined. Besides, when a function doesn't return a value, it returns undefined. <br>

        <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold m-5 text-blue-500">REST API</h1>
        <p class="text-xl font-semibold m-5">

            An API is a set of definitions and protocols for building and integrating application software. It’s sometimes referred to as a contract between an information provider and an information user—establishing the content required from the consumer (the call) and the content required by the producer (the response). For example, the API design for a weather service could specify that the user supply a zip code and that the producer reply with a 2-part answer, the first being the high temperature, and the second being the low.
